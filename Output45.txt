-       manufacturer         : string
-       model                : string
-       isDrivable           : bool
-       price                : double
Methods
+       «constructor» Car(
        year            : int,
        manufacturer    : string,
        model           : string,
        price           : double,
        isDrivable      : bool = true)
+       ToString()           : string

Description of field members [20 Points]:
1.      year: this private member represents the year value of this object
2.      manufacturer: this private member represents the manufacturer of this car
3.      model: this private member represents the model of this car
4.      isDrivable: this private member indicates if this car be driven
5.      price: this private member represents the selling price of this car
Constructor [30 points]:
1.      public Car(int year, string manufacturer, string model, double price, bool isDrivable = true): this is the constructor of this class. It takes five arguments and assigns them to the appropriate fields. You will assume that all the arguments will be sane (i.e. the values will not break your program).
Description of action member [20 points]:
1.      public override string ToString(): this method overrides the same method in the base class. It does not take any argument but it returns a string representing this object. You get to decide how the output will look like. It is expected that all the values be displayed.
Test the class [30 points]:
In your main method write the code to do the following:
1.      Create at least four cars and print them. Remember to call the constructor with different number of parameters.
